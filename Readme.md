# VBNET Portknocker

This app is used to perform a port knocking against a firewall.

## Getting Started

If you ever worked with Mikrotik, Draytek or Fortinet maybe you know how to deal with rules that become active before certain actions, such as port knocking.

### Prerequisites

You should have VB.NET and on the other side a firewall to test (e.g. Mikrotik)


### Installing
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the project with VB.NET and enjoy :)
Say what the step will be

### Using
Once youÂ´ve cloned this repo and read the code you can easily know that 3 actions are performed by the app
```
1. Send an ICMP to a host
2. Knock port 65000 TCP  of the host
3. Knock port 2 TCP of the host
```
